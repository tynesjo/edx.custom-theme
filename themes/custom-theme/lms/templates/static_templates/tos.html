Our goal is to provide current and future visitors to the Tynes.Science Site with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (to assess the learner’s level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to improve our understanding of the learning process, and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of our course materials, payment models, platform features, and offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under the 
<a href="https://tynes.science/privacy">Privacy Policy
</a>
, those publications or public disclosures will not include your personal information.

From time to time, Tynes.Science may offer services and products for a fee (for example, course and program certificates). For anything that you choose to purchase on the Tynes.Science Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees when due. As described in the 
<a href="https://tynes.science/privacy">Privacy Policy
</a>
, the processing of your payment information is done by a third-party payment vendor, and you will be routed to a secure payment flow controlled by that vendor to complete the payment transaction. Once your payment transaction is completed, an Tynes.Science confirmation page will be displayed, and you will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number, and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from Tynes.Science, as described below.
</p>
<h4 class="inline-p-heading">Certificates.
</h4>
<p>Tynes.Science may offer Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a "Verified Certificate") or certificates for programs for learners who, in the judgment of Tynes.Science, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course or program material. Certificates will be issued by Tynes.Science under the name of Tynes.Science. The decision whether a certificate will be awarded to a given learner will be solely within the discretion of Tynes.Science.
</p>
<p>
Subject to the foregoing, you will be required to pay a fee and complete the ID verification process for Verified Certificates. In order to authenticate your identity for a Verified Certificate, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Although these items are collected by Tynes.Science in accordance with these TOS and the 
<a href="https://tynes.science/privacy">Privacy Policy
</a>

<li>Passport

</li>
<li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself;

<li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted; and
</li>
<li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted.
